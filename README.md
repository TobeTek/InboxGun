# InboxGun
An Automation Workflow Module written in Python

> Tested on `Python 3.10.1`

## TODO: 
 - Resume Workflow inbetween execution
 - Add support for timed triggers. They don't need to subscribe to events and can be handled by a scheduler.
 - Make the logic for Running next steps more 'DRY'.
